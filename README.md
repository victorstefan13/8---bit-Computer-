# 8---bit-Computer-

The application was developed as an interface to allow the programming of the AT28C64B chip (64K (8K x 8) Parallel EEPROM) using the LPC1768 microcontroller. This was part an 8-bit computer which was designed by me and a fellow class colleague for our group project. The architecture chosen for this computer was Harvard based and comprised of separate separate memory areas for the program instructions and data, meaning that there are two separate buses which allow simultaneous access to both instructions and data. This was chosen because the execution time is very low which results in high speed processing however at the cost of more hardware complexity. 

This application was utilised for programming both the instruction set and memory data. The application provides a user interface which allows for easy programming of the chip though the terminal of the LCP1768.
